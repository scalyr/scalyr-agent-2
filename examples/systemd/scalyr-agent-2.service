# This file contains sample systemd config file for the scalyr agent.
#
# It can be used / installed with the following commands:
#
# sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/scalyr-agent-2.service
# sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/scalyr-agent-2.service
#
# Add the content bellow to /etc/systemd/system/scalyr-agent-2.service file
#
# reload systemd configs:
#
# sudo systemctl daemon-reload
#
# You can then use standard systemd commands to control the agent service.
#
# 1. sudo systemctl enable scalyr-agent-2 - make sure agent starts on boot
# 2. sudo systemctl start scalyr-agent-2 - start the service
# 3. sudo systemctl restart scalyr-agent-2 - restart the service
# 4. sudo journalctl -f -u scalyr-agent-2 - view service logs
#
# All the agent info level logs will also be managed via journald (in addition to being it available
# in the usual location at /var/log/scalyr-agent-2/agent.json) which means you can use journalctl
# comamnd to view / tail main agent.info log file
#
# sudo journalctl -f -u scalyr-agent-2
#
# You also need to remove symlinks which are used by init.d to start the service on boot.
#
# On Debian systems with update-rc.d:
#
# sudo update-rc.d -f scalyr-agent-2 remove
#
# On RHEL systems with chkconfig:
#
# sudo chkconfig --del scalyr-agent-2
#
# On other systems without chkconfig or update-rc.d:
#
# sudo rm /etc/rc{0,1,6}/K02scalyr-agent-2
# sudo rm /etc/rc{2,3,4,5}/S98scalyr-agent-2
#
# Keep in mind that you will need to run those steps each time agent is upgraded since our
# post install script creates that symlink.
#
# In the future we plan to ship distribution specific packages when systemd will be configured
# out of the box on supported distros and those manual commands won't be needed.

# it means logs also go to journald, etc. and it behaves more like a proper systemd service
