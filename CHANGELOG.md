Scalyr Agent 2 Changes By Release
=================================

## 2.1.4 "TBD" - May 5, 2020

<!---
Packaged by Steven Czerwinski <czerwin@scalyr.com> on May 5, 2020 08:30 -0800
--->

Features
* Add support for ``zstandard`` and ``lz4`` compression of outgoing requests to the Scalyr API. For backward compatibility reasons, the default value for ``compression_type`` configuration option still is ``deflate``.

## 2.1.3 "Orion" - May 1, 2020

<!---
Packaged by Steven Czerwinski <czerwin@scalyr.com> on May 1, 2020 09:30 -0800
--->

Features
* The Kubernetes and Kubernetes event monitors now allow you to restrict the namespaces for which the Scalyr Agent will collect logs and events.  This may be controlled via the `SCALYR_K8S_INCLUDE_NAMESPACES` environment variable or `k8s_include_namespaces` configuration option.  See [release notes](https://github.com/scalyr/scalyr-agent-2/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md#213-orion---may-1-2020) for more information.

Bugs
* Fixed Kubernetes monitor to verify by default TLS connections made to the local Kubelet.  This was causing an excessive amount of warnings to be emitted to the stdout.  See [release notes](https://github.com/scalyr/scalyr-agent-2/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md#213-orion---may-1-2020) for details on how to disable verification if this causes issues.
* Fixed issue preventing the Apache monitor from running under Python 2.
* Fixed some issues causing some logging to fail due to incorrect arguments.

## 2.1.2 "Nostromo" - April 23, 2020

<!---
Packaged by Steven Czerwinski <czerwin@scalyr.com> on Apr 23, 2020 08:30 -0800
--->

Features

* The Agent no longer enforces all events must have monotonically increasing timestamps when pushed into Scalyr.  The is now possible due to changes in the server.  This allow better use of the default timestamps, such as in Docker and Kubernetes.
* Log lines collected via the Kubernetes or Docker monitors will now have their default timestamps set to the timestamp generated by K8s/Docker.  As long as a parser does not override the timestamp, the K8s and Docker timestamps will be used in Scalyr.
* Agent logs with severity higher than INFO will now be output to stdout as well as the `agent.log` file when running with the `--no-fork` flag.
* The Journald monitor now supports a `detect_escaped_strings` option which automatically detects if the `details` field is already an escaped string, and if so, just emits it directly to the log instead of re-escaping it.  This option is specified using the `journald_logs` array.  See the [journald monitor documentation](https://www.scalyr.com/help/monitors/journald) for more details.

Bugs
* Fixed monitor configuration bug that prevented config options that did not have a default nor were required from being properly set via environment variables.

Optimizations

* Optimize RFC3339 date strings parsing. This should result in better throughput under highly loaded scenarios (many lines per second) when using Docker / Kubernetes monitor.
* Speed up event serialization under highly loaded scenarios by optimizing json encoding and encoding of event attributes.
* We now default to ``orjson`` JSON library under Python 3 (if the library is available). ``orjson`` is substantially faster than ``ujson`` for encoding.

## 2.1.1 "Millenium Falcon" - Mar 30, 2020

<!---
Packaged by Steven Czerwinski <czerwin@scalyr.com> on Mar 30, 2020 16:30 -0800
--->

Features
* Major update of code base to support running under Python 2 and 3.  See [release notes](https://github.com/scalyr/scalyr-agent-2/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md) for more information.
* Agent now supports Python 2.6, 2.7 and >= 3.5
* When installing using RPM or Debian, Python 2 will be used by default unless unavailable.
* The Python version used to run the Agent may be controlled using the `scalyr-switch-python` command.
* The K8s manifest files have been changed to run the Agent in the `scalyr` namespace instead of the `default` namespace.  When updating an existing Scalyr Agent K8s instance, you must follow the upgrade instructions described in the [upgrade notes](https://github.com/scalyr/scalyr-agent-2/blob/master/upgrade_notes.md).
* RPM and Debian packages no longer declare dependency on Python to promote cross-distribution compatibility.  The dependency is now verified at package install time.
* Added option to `scalyr-agent-2 status -v` to emit JSON (``--format=[text|json]``).
* Add new ``metric_name_blacklist`` supported attribute to each monitor configuration section. With this attribute, user can define a list of metric names which should be excluded and not shipped to Scalyr.
* Add support for ``orjson`` JSON library when running under Python 3. This library offers significantly better performance and can be enabled by setting ``json_library`` config option to ``orjson`` and installing ``orjson`` Python package using pip.

Bugs
* Fix authentication issue in `kubernetes_monitor` when accessing kublet API.
* Better error messages issued when missing required certificate files.
* Updated Kubernetes manifest file to use `apps/v1` for DaemonSet API version instead of beta version.
* Update scalyr client code to log raw uncompressed body under debug log level to aid with troubleshooting.
* Metric type for ``app.disk.requests.{read,write}`` metrics has been fixed.
* Fix ``iostat`` monitor so it also works with newer versions of Linux kernel.
* Fix invalid extra field for two ``tomcat.runtime.threads`` metrics in the Tomcat monitor (all of the metrics had type set to ``max`` whereas one should have type set to ``active`` and the other to ``busy``).

Minor updates
* The ``/etc/init.d/scalyr-agent-2`` symlink is no longer marked as a conf file in Debian packages.
* Update of embedded ecsda library to 0.13.3
* Docker support now requires the docker 4.1 client library
* Changed which signal is used to execute `scalyr-agent-2 status -v` under Linux to improve handling of SIGINT. Previously ``SIGINT`` was used, now ``SIGUSR1`` is used.
* When running in foreground mode (``--no-fork`` flag), SIGINT signal (aka CTRL+C) now starts the graceful shutdown procedure.
* Two new metrics (``app.io.wait``, ``app.mem.majflt``) are now emitted by the Linux process monitor. If you want those metrics to be excluded for your monitors, you can utilize new ``metric_name_blacklist`` monitor config option.

Testing updates
* Numerous changes to improve testing and coverage reporting

## 2.0.59 "Lady MacBeth" - Feb 13, 2020

<!---
Packaged by Steven Czerwinski <czerwin@scalyr.com> on Feb 13, 2020 10:30 -0800
--->

Feature
* Improved support for handling long log lines captured by `kubernetes_monitor` and `docker_monitor`.  When parsing docker logs, the serialized JSON objects can now be up to `internal_parse_max_line_size` bytes (defaults to 64KB).  This replaces the requirement they be less than `max_line_size`.  The `log` field extracted from the JSON object is still subjected to the `max_line_size` limit.
* Improved handling when `kubernetes_monitor` fails due to an uninitialized K8s cache.  If a `kubernetes_monitor` becomes stuck for 2 minutes and cannot initialize, the agent will terminate its container to allow for K8s to restart it.

Bugs
* Add additional diagnostic information to help customers troubleshoot issues in the `kubernetes_monitor` due to failures in K8s cache initialization.
* Fix bug due to protected access in the `journald_monitor`.

## 2.0.58 "Karrajor" - Jan 23, 2020

## 2.0.56 "Icarus" - Jan 15, 2020

<!---
Packaged by Steven Czerwinski <czerwin@scalyr.com> on Jan 8, 2020 14:30 -0800
--->

Features

<!---
Packaged by Imron Alston <imron@scalyr.com> on Sep 18, 2019 15:00 -0700
--->

Features
* Collection of per CPU metric data under docker/kubernetes has been placed behind the config option `docker_percpu_metrics` (defaulted to `False`) to prevent collecting excessive metrics on machines with a large number of cores.

Miscellaneous changes
* Added scripts for bringing up/tearing down large clusters for testing
* Fixed problem with smoketest scripts


## 2.0.52 "Einstein-Rosen Bridge" - Sep 16, 2019

<!---
Packaged by Edward Chee <echee@scalyr.com> on Sep 16, 2019 11:00 -0700
--->

Features
* K8s serverHosts are no longer displayed in Scalyr UI Log Sources (thus avoiding situations where hundreds of serverHost entries pollute the Log Sources overview).

Bugs
* MySQL monitor plugin fails to connect to Amazon RDS instances. Note: the fix requires python 2.7 so customers running older python versions will no longer be able to run the MySQL monitor from this release onward.


## 2.0.51 "Daniel Jackson" - Sep 5, 2019

<!---
Packaged by Edward Chee <echee@scalyr.com> on Sep 5, 2019 15:00 -0700
--->

Features
* Major refactor of kubernetes_monitor (rate-limit k8s api master calls and avoid large api master queries). Tested on a 1000-node cluster.

Bugs
* You can now set config params to empty string, thus allowing overriding of non-null default values (e.g. set `k8s_ignore_namespaces` to empty list instead of default `kube-system`).
* `k8s_ignore_namespaces` is now a comma-separated array-of-strings (legacy space-separated behavior is still supported).
* JSON logs were causing `total_bytes_skipped` to incorrectly report as always increasing in agent.log `agent_status` line.
* Python 2.5 sometimes fails to launch because `httplib.HTTPConnection._tunnel_host` is not present.

Miscellaneous changes
* Emit log message indicating whether kubernetes_monitor is using docker socket or cri filesystem to query running containers.
* If an error is encountered while parsing JSON logs, do not log the offending JSON line in agent.log.
* Better reporting of stack trace when exception occurs in kubernetes & docker monitor _get_container() loops.

* Incorporate profiler into agent for runtime performance analysis.
* Add random skew to k8s api queries to lessen peak load on k8s api masters.

Bugs
* Fix Dockerfile.custom_k8s_config to use correct image
* Fix bug in Windows upgrade utility
* Fix attribute error in k8s controller object

Miscellaneous changes
* `scalyr-agent-2.yaml` now exports SCALYR_K8S_EVENTS_DISABLE instead of K8S_EVENTS_DISABLE

* New `strip_domain_from_default_server_host` configuration option to remove any domain name from `serverHost` when using the default value.

Bug fixes:

* Syslog/Docker fix that generated a `port already in use` error when reading new configuration file
* Syslog/Docker fix that caused dropped log lines when write rate exceeded certain threshold
* Syslog CPU performance improvements


## 2.0.23 "Xeric Xeme" - Jan 27, 2017

<!---
Packaged by Steven Czerwinski <czerwin@scalyr.com> on Jan 27, 2017 14:00 -0700
--->

Major overhaul of Docker support:

* New approach to improve stability across multiple versions of Docker
* Relies on Docker's `syslog` logging plugin
* Automatic collection of Docker metrics for all containers running on host
* Improved Dockerfiles to ease creating images with custom Scalyr Agent configuration
* Improved methods for configuring Scalyr Agent running within the container
* Customize where container log files are written
* See the [Docker installation documentation](https://www.scalyr.com/help/install-agent-docker) for more details.

Additional features:

* New `exclude` option for writing log matching rules.  When specifying which logs to collect using a glob pattern, you can exclude any of the matching logs using another glob.  The field value should be an array of glob patterns.
