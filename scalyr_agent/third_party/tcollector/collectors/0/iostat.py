"""iostat statistics for TSDB"""

# data is from /proc/diskstats

# Calculate disk statistics.  We handle 2.6 kernel output only, both
# pre-2.6.25 and post (which added back per-partition disk stats).
# (diskstats output significantly changed from 2.4).
# The fields (from iostats.txt) are mainly rate counters
# (either number of operations or number of milliseconds doing a
# particular operation), so let's just let TSD do the rate
# calculation for us.
#
# /proc/diskstats has 11 stats for a given device
# these are all rate counters except ios_in_progress
# .read_requests       Number of reads completed
# .read_merged         Number of reads merged
# .read_sectors        Number of sectors read
# .msec_read           Time in msec spent reading
# .write_requests      Number of writes completed
# .write_merged        Number of writes merged
# .write_sectors       Number of sectors written
# .msec_write          Time in msec spent writing
# .ios_in_progress     Number of I/O operations in progress
# .msec_total          Time in msec doing I/O
# .msec_weighted_total Weighted time doing I/O (multiplied by ios_in_progress)

# in 2.6.25 and later, by-partition stats are reported same as disks
# in 2.6 before 2.6.25, partitions have 4 stats per partition
# .read_issued
# .read_sectors
# .write_issued
# .write_sectors
# For partitions, these *_issued are counters collected before
# requests are merged, so aren't the same as *_requests (which is
# post-merge, which more closely represents represents the actual
# number of disk transactions).

# Given that diskstats provides both per-disk and per-partition data,
# for TSDB purposes we want to put them under different metrics (versus
# the same metric and different tags).  Otherwise, if you look at a
# given metric, the data for a given box will be double-counted, since
# a given operation will increment both the disk series and the
# partition series.  To fix this, we output by-disk data to iostat.disk.*
# and by-partition data to iostat.part.*.

# TODO: Add additional tags to map partitions/disks back to mount
# points/swap so you can (for example) plot just swap partition
# activity or /var/lib/mysql partition activity no matter which
# disk/partition this happens to be.  This is nontrivial, especially
# when you have to handle mapping of /dev/mapper to dm-N, pulling out
# swap partitions from /proc/swaps, etc.

# TODO: add some generated stats from iostat -x like svctm, await,
# %util.  These need to pull in cpu idle counters from /proc.
