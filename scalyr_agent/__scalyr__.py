# The first option is to provide 2->3 compatibility without "six". This is easy for now,

# One of the main things this file does is correctly give the full path to two key directories regardless of install
# type :
#   package_root:  The directory containing the Scalyr source (contains files like 'agent_main.py', etc)
#   install_root:  The top-level directory where Scalyr is currently installed (contains files like 'CHANGELOG.md')
#
# There are several different ways we can be running, and this files has to give the correct values for each of them.
# For example, we could just be running out of the source tree as checked into github.  Or we can be running
# out of an RPM.  Or as part of a single Windows executable created by PyInstaller.  We handle of these cases.
#
# Example layouts for different install types:
#
# Running from source:
#     ~/scalyr-agent-2/VERSION
#     ~/scalyr-agent-2/scalyr-agent/__scalyr__.py
#     ~/scalyr-agent-2/scalyr-agent/third_party
#
#   Here the install root is ~/scalyr-agent-2 and the package root is ~/scalyr-agent-2/scalyr-agent
#
# Install using tarball:
#     ~/scalyr-agent-2/py/scalyr_agent/VERSION
#     ~/scalyr-agent-2/py/scalyr_agent/__scalyr__py
#     ~/scalyr-agent-2/py/scalyr_agent/third_party
#
#   Here the install root is ~/scalyr-agent-2 and the package root is ~/scalyr-agent-2/py/scalyr-agent
#
# Install using rpm/deb package:
#     /usr/share/scalyr-agent-2/py/scalyr_agent/VERSION
#     /usr/share/scalyr-agent-2/py/scalyr_agent/__scalyr__py
#     /usr/share/scalyr-agent-2/py/scalyr_agent/third_party
#
#   Here the install root is /usr/share/scalyr-agent-2 and the package root is /usr/share/scalyr-agent-2/py/scalyr-agent
#
# Install using win32 exe:
#     C:\Program Files (x86)\Scalyr\program_files\VERSION
#     C:\Program Files (x86)\Scalyr\program_files\__scalyr__.py
#     (There is no third party directory... its contents gets added directly to program_files
#
#   Here the install root is C:\Program Files (x86)\Scalyr\ and the package root is
#   C:\Program Files (x86)\Scalyr\program_files\
