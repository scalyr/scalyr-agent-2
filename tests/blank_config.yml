# This file can be used as a blank template to specify test settings and also to specify essential environment variables for the agent smoke tests.
# Usage:
# - Create copy of this file named 'config.yml' (path to this file is added to .gitignore)
# - Fill it with needed values. Py.test expects those values as environment variables, but if it does not find them, it gets those values from this config.

agent_settings:
  SCALYR_API_KEY: # this goes as environment variable.
  READ_API_KEY: # this goes as environment variable.
  SCALYR_SERVER: # this goes as environment variable.
  AGENT_HOST_NAME: # this goes to agent.json config as 'server_attributes.serverHost'
