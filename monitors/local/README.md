Third-party private monitor plugins
===================================

This directory can be used to hold monitor plugins developed by third parties who have forked the scalyr-agent-2
repository and do not wish to contrib the plugins to the main Scalyr repository.

Any monitors placed in this directory will be included in the local monitors directory the scaly-agent-2 package
(RPM, Debian, tarball) built by the `build_package.py` tool in the root of this repository.
