# Shell Monitor

This agent monitor plugin periodically executes a specified shell command, and records the output.
It can be used to monitor any information that can be retrieved via a shell command. Shell commands
are run from the Scalyr Agent, and execute as the same user as the agent.

@class=bg-warning docInfoPanel: An *agent monitor plugin* is a component of the Scalyr Agent. To use a plugin,
simply add it to the ``monitors`` section of the Scalyr Agent configuration file (``/etc/scalyr/agent.json``).
For more information, see [Agent Plugins](/help/scalyr-agent#plugins).

## Sample Configuration

Here is a simple configuration fragment showing use of the shell_monitor plugin. This sample will record
the version of the Linux kernel in use on the machine where the agent is running.

    monitors: [
      {
        module:  "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.shell_monitor",
        id:      "kernel-version",
        command: "uname -r"
      }
    ]

To record output from more than one command, use several copies of the shell_monitor plugin in your configuration.

## Viewing Data

After adding this plugin to the agent configuration file, wait one minute for data to begin recording. Then go to
the Search page and search for [$monitor = 'shell_monitor'](/events?filter=$monitor%20%3D%20%27shell_monitor%27).
This will show all data collected by this plugin, across all servers. You can use the {{menuRef:Refine search by}}
dropdown to narrow your search to specific servers and monitors.

The [View Logs](/help/view) page describes the tools you can use to view and analyze log data.
[Query Language](/help/query-language) lists the operators you can use to select specific metrics and values.
You can also use this data in [Dashboards](/help/dashboards) and [Alerts](/help/alerts).

## Configuration Reference

|||# Option            ||| Usage
|||# ``module``        ||| Always ``scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.shell_monitor``
|||# ``id``            ||| Included in each log message generated by this monitor, as a field named ``instance``. \
                           Allows you to distinguish between values recorded by different monitors.
|||# ``command``       ||| The shell command to execute.
|||# ``extract``       ||| Optional: a regular expression to apply to the command output. If defined, this expression \
                           must contain a matching group (i.e. a subexpression enclosed in parentheses). The monitor \
                           will record only the content of that matching group. This allows you to discard unnecessary \
                           portions of the command output and extract the information you need.
|||# ``log_all_lines`` ||| Optional (defaults to false). If true, the monitor will record the entire command output; \
                           otherwise, it only records the first line.
|||# ``max_characters``||| Optional (defaults to 200). At most this many characters of output are recorded. You may \
                           specify a value up to 10000, but the Scalyr server currently truncates all fields to 3500 \
                           characters.

## Log reference

Each event recorded by this plugin will have the following fields:

|||# Field       ||| Meaning
|||# ``monitor`` ||| Always ``shell_monitor``.
|||# ``instance``||| The ``id`` value from the monitor configuration, e.g. ``kernel-version``.
|||# ``command`` ||| The shell command for this plugin instance, e.g. ``uname -r``.
|||# ``metric``  ||| Always ``output``.
|||# ``value``   ||| The output of the shell command, e.g. ``3.4.73-64.112.amzn1.x86_64``.
