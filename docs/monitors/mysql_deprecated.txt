These are values computed by the MySQL monitor plugin based on raw data collected from MySQL. Most values reflect performance since
the MySQL server was last started.

|||#Metric name                                     ||| Description
|||``mysql.derived.slow_query_percentage``          ||| Measure of what percentage of queries are taking a long time \
                                                        to execute. The value of what defines a "long time" is \
                                                        controlled by the variable "long_query_time" within the MySQL \
                                                        config file (the default as of MySQL 5.0 is 10 seconds). \
                                                        The higher the percentage, the more your server is being kept \
                                                        busy fulfilling requests and the possible higher load on your \
                                                        server.
|||``mysql.derived.connections_used_percentage``    ||| Measure, as a percentage, of how many of simultaneous \
                                                        connections were used out of the number of connections \
                                                        configured within the MySQL configuration file.  If connections\
                                                        run out, client requests will be blocked.  A high percentage \
                                                        could indicate an application not making efficient use of \
                                                        connections (for instance, not caching an existing connection)\
                                                        or it could indicate more clients connecting than anticipated.
|||``mysql.derived.aborted_connections_percentage`` ||| A percentage of client connection attempts that fail to \
                                                        connect.  Typical reasons include a client doesn't have \
                                                        permission to connect to the database (or invalid password),\
                                                        a corrupt connection packet from the client, or the client \
                                                        is slow in sending it's connect message.  This could \
                                                        indicate something wrong with the clients or possibly even \
                                                        attempts to break into the server.
|||``mysql.derived.aborted_clients_percentage``     ||| A measure of the number of clients that disconnect improperly\
                                                        (the don't close the connection).  This could indicate a \
                                                        poorly written client, inactivity on the part of clients, or \
                                                        possibly a problematic connection to the database.
|||``mysql.derived.read_percentage``                ||| Measure of what percentage of database activity is reads. \
                                                        Depending on your configuration, a high read percentage could \
                                                        be expected or might be a problem.  If you have setup read \
                                                        slaves and write masters and the masters show heavy reads, that\
                                                        could indicate a problem.
|||``mysql.derived.write_percentage``               ||| Measure of what percentage of database activity is writes. \
                                                        Writes are generally quite costly and could impact read \
                                                        performance.
|||``mysql.derived.query_cache_efficiency``         ||| Measure of what percentage of queries are cached.  A higher \
                                                        percentage means that the query will be more responsive.  \
                                                        A low percentage could indicate that queries aren't used \
                                                        that often or the query cache size is not sufficient to keep \
                                                        the queries that do get made in memory.
|||``mysql.derived.joins_without_indexes``          ||| A count of the number of joins performing table scans that do \
                                                        not use indices as well as the joins that check for key usage \
                                                        after each row.  If this value is greater than 0, it could \
                                                        indicate missing or improper indexes on your tables.
|||``mysql.derived.table_cache_hit_rate``           ||| How efficient is the table cache being used?  If the hit rate \
                                                        is low, then increasing the size of the table cache could be \
                                                        beneficial.  Note, that the larger the table cache, however, \
                                                        the more file descriptors are used by the system.
|||``mysql.derived.open_file_percentage``           ||| Of the allowed number of open files, what percentage of them \
                                                        are open.  The higher the percentage, the more file descriptors\
                                                        MySQL is using and the likelihood of operations being delayed \
                                                        (or failing) if too many files are open.  A solution may be as \
                                                        simple as uping the "open_file_limit" in the MySQL config.
|||``mysql.derived.immediate_table_lock_percentage``||| What percentage of requests to lock a table are granted \
                                                        immediately versus having to wait?  For instance, is another \
                                                        operation locking the table.  If this value is low and there \
                                                        are performance issues, it might be worth considering looking \
                                                        at the table structure or possibly replication.
|||``mysql.derived.thread_cache_hit_rate``          ||| For each connection, a thread is needed.  If this value is low,\
                                                        it indicates that either you have unexpected traffic loads or \
                                                        need to allocate more resources to the thread cache.
|||``mysql.derived.tmp_disk_table_percentage``      ||| When MySQL needs to create a temp table (for instance due to \
                                                        a join), how many of the tables created need to be written to \
                                                        disk?  A high percentage could indicate that either your \
                                                        database operations are creating temporary tables that are \
                                                        large or you need to increase the space allocated for in \
                                                        memory temp tables.
