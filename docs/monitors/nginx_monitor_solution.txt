Install Nginx Monitor

This Solution describes how to setup and make use of the Nginx Monitor included with the Scalyr agent.  The preconfigured dashboard incorporates some statistics that help monitor the health of your server.

Prerequisites:

1.  Nginx is installed and running.  To verify:
    - At a terminal prompt, enter the command "ps aux | grep nginx".  
    - You should see something resembling:

        root      5806  0.0  0.1  85872 1340 ?   Ss   07:58   0:00 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx
        www-data  5808  0.0  0.2  86152 1760 ?   S    07:58   0:00 nginx: worker process
        www-data  5809  0.0  0.2  86152 1760 ?   S    07:58   0:00 nginx: worker process
        www-data  5810  0.0  0.2  86152 2016 ?   S    07:58   0:00 nginx: worker process
        www-data  5811  0.0  0.2  86152 1760 ?   S    07:58   0:00 nginx: worker process
        
    - If it is not running, consult the specifics for your OS / Distribution on how to start Nginx

2.  Root access to edit the Nginx configuration

Steps:

1.  In your Nginx configuration, under the "server" directive, add the following:

        location /nginx_status {
          stub_status on; 
          allow 127.0.0.1; 
          deny all;        
        }
        
2.  Restart Nginx.

3.  Verify you can get to the status page, using curl, you would type the following:

        curl --interface "127.0.0.1" http://localhost/nginx_status
        
4.  The output should resemble:

        Active connections: 1 
        server accepts handled requests
         58 58 58 
        Reading: 0 Writing: 1 Waiting: 0

5.  In your Scalyr Agent configuration file, you will need to add one of the following stanza to the monitor section to enable the Nginx Monitor:

        {
            module: "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.nginx_monitor"
        }
6.  Restart your Scalyr Agent, allow some data to collect, and click "Dashboards" in the navigation bar, and select the "Nginx" dashboard.

7.  The Nginx dashboard will present you with a series of graphs.

Dashboard Graphs

There are a number of pre-configured graphs that are part of the MySQL dashboard.  The graphs are as follows:

    - Active Connections
        - metric: nginx.connections.active
        - The graph shows a running count of the active connections over time.  Spikes in connections could signify an event triggering an unusual amount of activity.

    - Connections Reading
        - metric: nginx.connections.reading
        - The graph shows the number of connections currently reading data from the connected clients.
        
    - Connections Writing
        - metric: nginx.connections.writing
        - The graph shows the number of connections currently writing data to the connected clients.
        
    - Connections Waiting
        - metric: nginx.connections.waiting
        - The graph shows the number of connections currently idle / sending keep-alives.
