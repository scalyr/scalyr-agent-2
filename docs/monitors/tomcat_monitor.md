# Tomcat Monitor

The Tomcat monitor allows you to collect data about the usage and performance of your Tomcat server.

Each monitor can be configured to monitor a specific Tomcat server, thus allowing you to configure alerts and the
dashboard entries independently (if desired) for each instance.

## Configuring TomcatMonitor

In order to use this monitor, you will need to configure a couple of things in your Tomcat
instance:

- Installation of the management utilities
- Adding a user role with monitoring privileges

Installation of the Management Utilities

If you are (or have) installed Tomcat from sources, please consult the documentation for your
version of Tomcat at http://tomcat.apache.org.  For Redhat (and related variants), the
administrator webapps are contained in a package  named tomcat<version>-admin-webapps.
For Debian (and related variants) the administrator webapps are contained in the package
named tomcat<version>-admin.

To check to see, say for Tomcat version 7, if you already have the admin webapps already
installed, you can issue the command 'dpkg -l | grep tomcat7' or look for the file
manager.xml in the directory /etc/tomcat7/Catalina/localhost.

Adding a User Role with Monitoring Privileges

Users are configured in a file named tomcat-users.xml.  This file, for Ubuntu, is located
(for version 7 of Tomcat) in /etc/tomcat7.  Tomcat provides a number of roles with differing
types of access.  For purposes of getting server status, that role is "manager-status".  The
details of the Manager can be found in the Tomcat documentation here:  http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/manager-howto.html

To add user "statusmon" with password "getstatus", you would open up the tomcat-users.xml file
and edit the tomcat-users section to resemble:

<tomcat-users>
  ...
  <role rolename="manager-status"/>
  <user username="statusmon" password="getstatus" roles="manager-status"/>
</tomcat-users>

## Configuring Scalyr Agent

In order to use the Tomcat monitor, you need to enter a configuration in the agent.json
file.  A typical fragment resembles:

  monitors: [
    {
      module:              "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.tomcat_monitor",
      id:                  "tomcat",
      monitor_url:         "http://localhost:8080/manager/status",
      monitor_username:    "statusmon",
      monitor_password:    "getstatus"
    }
  ]

Note the ``id`` field in the configurations.  This is an optional field that allows you to specify an identifier
specific to a particular instance of Nginx and will make it easier to filter on metrics specific to that
instance.

## Configuration Reference

|||# Option              ||| Usage
|||# ``module``          ||| Always ``scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.tomcat_monitor ``
|||# ``id``              ||| Optional. Included in each log message generated by this monitor, as a field named \
                             ``instance``. Allows you to distinguish between values recorded by different monitors. \
                             This is especially useful if you are running multiple PostgreSQL instances on a single \
                             server; you can monitor each instance with a separate tomcatql_monitor record in the \
                             Scalyr Agent configuration.
|||# ``monitor_url``     ||| Name of host machine the agent will connect to PostgreSQL to retrieve monitoring data.
|||# ``monitor_user``    ||| The username required to access the monitor URL.
|||# ``monitor_password``||| The pasword associated with the monitor_user required to access the monitor URL.
|||# ``source_address``  ||| Optional (defaults to '127.0.0.1'). The IP address to be used as the source address when \
                             fetching the monitor URL.  Some servers require this to be 127.0.0.1 because they only \
                             server the monitor page to requests from localhost.

## Log reference

Each event recorded by this plugin will have the following fields:

|||# Field       ||| Meaning
|||# ``monitor`` ||| Always ``tomcat_monitor``.
|||# ``instance``||| The ``id`` value from the monitor configuration.
|||# ``metric``  ||| The name of a metric being measured, e.g. "tomcat.runtime".
|||# ``value``   ||| The metric value.

## Metrics

The table below describes the metrics recorded by the monitor.
