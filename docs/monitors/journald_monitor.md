# Journald Monitor

A Scalyr agent monitor that imports log entries from journald.

The journald monitor polls systemd journal files every ``journal_poll_interval`` seconds
and uploads any new entries to the Scalyr servers.

@class=bg-warning docInfoPanel: An *agent monitor plugin* is a component of the Scalyr Agent. To use a plugin,
simply add it to the ``monitors`` section of the Scalyr Agent configuration file (``/etc/scalyr/agent.json``).
For more information, see [Agent Plugins](/help/scalyr-agent#plugins).

By default, the journald monitor logs all log entries, but it can also be configured to filter entries by specific
fields.

## Dependencies

The journald monitor has a dependency on the Python systemd library, which is a Python wrapper around the systemd C API.
You need to ensure this library has been installed on your system in order to use this monitor, otherwise a warning
message will be printed if the Scalyr Agent is configured to use the journald monitor but the systemd library cannot be
found.

You can install the systemd Python library via package manager e.g.:

    apt-get install python-systemd  (debian/ubuntu)
    dnf install python-systemd  (CentOS/rhel/Fedora)

Or install it from source using pip e.g.

    pip install systemd-python

See here for more information: https://github.com/systemd/python-systemd/

## Sample Configuration

The following example will configure the agent to query the journal entries
located in /var/log/journal (the default location for persisted journald logs)

    monitors: [
      {
        module: "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.journald_monitor",
      }
    ]

Here is an example that queries journal entries from volatile/non-persisted journals, and filters those entries to only
include ones that originate from the ssh service

    monitors: [
      {
        module: "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.journald_monitor",
        journal_path: "/run/log/journal",
        journal_matches: ["_SYSTEMD_UNIT=ssh.service"]
      }
    ]

## Polling the Journal File

The journald monitor polls the journal file every ``journal_poll_interval`` seconds to check for new logs.  It does this by
creating a polling object (https://docs.python.org/2/library/select.html#poll-objects) and calling the ``poll`` method
of that object.  The ``poll`` method is called with a 0 second timeout so it never blocks.
After processing any new events, or if there are no events to process, the monitor thread sleeps for ``journal_poll_interval``
seconds and then polls again.

## Configuration Reference

|||# Option                      ||| Usage
|||# ``journal_path``            ||| Optional (defaults to /var/log/journal). Location on the filesystem of the \
                                     journald logs.
|||# ``journal_poll_interval``   ||| Optional (defaults to 5). The number of seconds to wait for data while polling \
                                     the journal file. Fractional values are supported. Note: This values overrides \
                                     the sample_interval of the monitor
|||# ``journal_fields``          ||| Optional dict containing a list of journal fields to include with each message, \
                                     as well as a field name to map them to.
Note: Not all fields need to exist in \
                                     every message and only fields that exist will be included.
Defaults to {:
  \
                                     "_SYSTEMD_UNIT": "unit"
  "_PID": "pid"
  "_MACHINE_ID": "machine_id"
  \
                                     "_BOOT_ID": "boot_id"
  "_SOURCE_REALTIME_TIMESTAMP": timestamp"
}

|||# ``journal_matches``         ||| Optional list containing 'match' strings for filtering entries.A match string \
                                     follows the pattern  "FIELD=value" where FIELD is a field of the journal entry \
                                     e.g. _SYSTEMD_UNIT, _HOSTNAME, _GID and "value" is the value to filter that field \
                                     on, so a match string equal to "_SYSTEMD_UNIT=ssh.service" would filter query \
                                     results to make sure that all entries entries originated from the `ssh.service` \
                                     system unit. The journald monitor calls the journal reader method `add_match` for \
                                     each string in this list. See the journald documentation for details on how the \
                                     filtering works: \
                                     https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/python-systemd/journal.html#systemd.journal.Reader.add_match \
                                     If this config item is empty or None then no filtering occurs.
|||# ``id``                      ||| Optional id used to differentiate between multiple journald monitors. This is \
                                     useful for configurations that define multiple journald monitors and that want to \
                                     save unique checkpoints for each monitor.  If specified, the id is also sent to \
                                     the server along with other attributes under the `monitor_id` field
|||# ``staleness_threshold_secs``||| When loading the journal events from a checkpoint, if the logs are older than \
                                     this threshold, then skip to the end.
|||# ``max_log_rotations``       ||| How many rotated logs to keep before deleting them, when writing journal entries \
                                     to a log for sending to Scalyr.
|||# ``max_log_size``            ||| Max size of a log file before we rotate it out, when writing journal entries to a \
                                     log for sending to Scalyr.
