# PostgreSQL Monitor

The PostgreSQL monitor allows you to collect data about the usage and performance of your PostgreSQL server.

Each monitor can be configured to monitor a specific PostgreSQL database, thus allowing you to configure alerts and the
dashboard entries independently (if desired) for each instance.

## Configuring PostgreSQL

To use Scalyr's PostgreSQL monitor, you will first need to configure your PostgreSQL server to enable password
authentication for a user as well as configure a user to connect to the database and gather the necessary data.

To configure PostgreSQL for password authentication, you will need a line like the following in your pg_hba.conf
file:

    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5

To create a user and enable password authentication, please consult the PostgreSQL documentation.  For version
9.3, that documentation can be found here:  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-createrole.html

### Configuring the PostgreSQL monitor

The PostgreSQL monitor is included with the Scalyr agent.  In order to configure it, you will need to add its monitor
configuration to the Scalyr agent config file.

A basic PostgreSQL monitor configuration entry might resemble:

  monitors: [
    {
      module:              "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.postgres_monitor",
      id:                  "mydb",
      database_host:       "localhost",
      database_name:       "<database>",
      database_username:   "<username>",
      database_password:   "<password>"
    }
  ]

Note the ``id`` field in the configurations.  This is an optional field that allows you to specify an identifier
specific to a particular instance of PostgreSQL and will make it easier to filter on metrics specific to that
instance.
## Configuration Reference

|||# Option               ||| Usage
|||# ``module``           ||| Always ``scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.postgres_monitor ``
|||# ``id``               ||| Optional. Included in each log message generated by this monitor, as a field named \
                              ``instance``. Allows you to distinguish between values recorded by different monitors. \
                              This is especially useful if you are running multiple PostgreSQL instances on a single \
                              server; you can monitor each instance with a separate postgresql_monitor record in the \
                              Scalyr Agent configuration.
|||# ``database_host``    ||| Name of host machine the agent will connect to PostgreSQL to retrieve monitoring data.
|||# ``database_port``    ||| Name of port on the host machine the agent will connect to PostgreSQL to retrieve \
                              monitoring data.
|||# ``database_name``    ||| Name of database the agent will connect to PostgreSQL to retrieve monitoring data.
|||# ``database_username``||| Username which the agent uses to connect to PostgreSQL to retrieve monitoring data.
|||# ``database_password``||| Password for connecting to PostgreSQL.

## Log reference

Each event recorded by this plugin will have the following fields:

|||# Field       ||| Meaning
|||# ``monitor`` ||| Always ``postgres_monitor``.
|||# ``instance``||| The ``id`` value from the monitor configuration.
|||# ``metric``  ||| The name of a metric being measured, e.g. "postgres.vars".
|||# ``value``   ||| The metric value.

## Metrics

The table below describes the metrics recorded by the monitor.


### connections metrics

|||# Metric                            ||| Description
|||# ``postgres.database.connections`` ||| The number of current active connections.  The value is accurate to when the \
