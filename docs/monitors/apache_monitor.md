# Apache Monitor

This agent monitor plugin records performance and usage data from an Apache server.

@class=bg-warning docInfoPanel: An *agent monitor plugin* is a component of the Scalyr Agent. To use a plugin,
simply add it to the ``monitors`` section of the Scalyr Agent configuration file (``/etc/scalyr/agent.json``).
For more information, see [Agent Plugins](/help/scalyr-agent#plugins).

## Configuring Apache

To use this monitor, you will need to configure your Apache server to enable the status module. For details,
see the [Apache documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_status.html).

First, verify that the module is enabled in your Apache server. On most Linux installations, you can use the
following command:

    ls /etc/apache2/mods-enabled

If you see ``status.conf`` and ``status.load`` present, the module is enabled. Otherwise, use the following
command (again, for most Linux installations):

    sudo /usr/sbin/a2enmod status

On some platforms, you may need to use different commands to enable the status module. Also, if Apache was
compiled manually, the module may not be available. Consult the documentation for your particular platform.
Here are some links:

- [CentOS 5/RHEL 5](https://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/5.1/Deployment_Guide/s1-apache-addmods.html)
- [Ubuntu 14.04](https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide/httpd.html)
- [Windows](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/platform/windows.html#cust)

Next, you must enable the status module, usually by updating the ``VirtualHost`` configuration section of your
Apache server. On Linux, this is typically found in the ``/etc/apache2/sites-available`` directory, in the file
that corresponds to your site.

Add the following to the ``VirtualHost`` section (between ``<VirtualHost>`` and ``</VirtualHost>``):

    <Location /server-status>
       SetHandler server-status
       Order deny,allow
       Deny from all
       Allow from 127.0.0.1
    </Location>

This specifies that the status page should be served at ``http://<address>/server-status``, and can't be accessed
from other servers.

Once you make the configuration change, you will need to restart Apache.  On most Linux systems, use the following
command:

    sudo service apache2 restart

To verify that the status module is working properly, you can view it manually. Execute this command on the server
(substituting the appropriate port number as needed):

    curl http://localhost:80/server-status

If you have any difficulty enabling the status module, drop us a line at [support@scalyr.com](mailto:support@scalyr.com).

## Sample Configuration

Here is a typical configuration fragment:

    monitors: [
      {
          module: "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.apache_monitor",
          status_url: "http://localhost:80/server-status/?auto"
      }
    ]

If your Apache server is running on a nonstandard port, replace ``80`` with the appropriate port number. For additional
options, see Configuration Reference.

accessLog:
## Uploading the Apache access log

If you have not already done so, you should also configure the Scalyr Agent to upload the access log
generated by Apache. Scalyr's Apache dashboard uses this log to generate many statistics.

For most Linux systems, the access log is saved in ``/var/log/apache2/access.log``. To upload, edit the
``logs`` section of ``/etc/scalyr-agent-2/agent.json``. Add the following entry:

    logs: [
       ...

    ***   {***
    ***     path: "/var/log/apache2/access.log",***
    ***     attributes: {parser: "accessLog", serverType: "apache"}***
    ***   }***
    ]

Edit the ``path`` field as appropriate for your system setup.

## Viewing Data

After adding this plugin to the agent configuration file, wait one minute for data to begin recording. Then
click the {{menuRef:Dashboards}} menu and select {{menuRef:Apache}}. (The dashboard may not be listed until
the agent begins sending Apache data.) You will see an overview of Apache data across all servers where you are
running the Apache plugin. Use the {{menuRef:ServerHost}} dropdown to show data for a specific server.

See [Analyze Access Logs](/solutions/analyze-access-logs) for more information about working with web access logs.

## Configuration Reference

|||# Option            ||| Usage
|||# ``module``        ||| Always ``scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.apache_monitor``
|||# ``id``            ||| Optional. Included in each log message generated by this monitor, as a field named \
                           ``instance``.  Allows you to distinguish between values recorded by different monitors. \
                           This is especially useful if you are running multiple Apache instances on a single server; \
                           you can monitor each instance with a separate apache_monitor record in the Scalyr Agent \
                           configuration.
|||# ``status_url``    ||| Optional.  Specifies the URL -- in particular, the port number -- at which the Apache \
                           status module is served.  The URL should end in ``/?auto`` to indicate the machine-readable \
                           version of the page should be returned.
|||# ``source_address``||| Optional (defaults to '127.0.0.1'). The IP address to be used as the source address when \
                           fetching the status URL.  Many servers require this to be 127.0.0.1 because they only \
                           server the status page to requests from localhost.

## Log reference

Each event recorded by this plugin will have the following fields:

|||# Field       ||| Meaning
|||# ``monitor`` ||| Always ``apache_monitor``.
|||# ``metric``  ||| The metric name.  See the metric tables for more information.
|||# ``value``   ||| The value of the metric.
|||# ``instance``||| The ``id`` value from the monitor configuration.

## Metrics

The table below describes the metrics recorded by the monitor.

|||# Metric                         ||| Description
|||# ``apache.connections.active``  ||| The number of connections that are being handled asynchronously (not using  \
                                        workers) currently open on the server
|||# ``apache.connections.writing`` ||| The number of connections that are being handled asynchronously (not using \
                                        workers) that are currently writing response data.
|||# ``apache.connections.idle``    ||| The number of connections that are being handled asynchronously (not using \
                                        workers) that are currently idle / sending keepalives.
|||# ``apache.connections.closing`` ||| The number of connections that are being handled asynchronously (not using \
                                        workers) that are currently closing.
|||# ``apache.workers.active``      ||| How many workers are currently active.  Each worker is a process handling an \
                                        incoming request.
|||# ``apache.workers.idle``        ||| How many of the workers are currently idle.  Each worker is a process that can \
                                        handle an incoming request.
