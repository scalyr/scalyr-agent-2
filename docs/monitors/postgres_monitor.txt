PostgreSQL Monitor

This agent monitor plugin records performance and usage data from a PostgreSQL server.


Configuring PostgreSQL

In order to use this monitor, you will need to configure a user account that will allow
access to the PostgreSQL database.  PostgreSQL has differing methods for user authentication.
This configuration is controlled within the PostgreSQL's pg_hba.conf file.  Typical entries
might include:

    # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
    local   all             all                                     peer
    local   all             all                                     md5
    # IPv4 local connections:
    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5

For a description of the pg_hba.conf file, please refer to the PostgreSQL documentation for
the version of PostgreSQL you are running.  For version 9.3, the documentation can be found
here:  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html

In the above configuration, we are interested in the line:

    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
    
This line specifies that the server will allow users to connect from localhost using a 
password.

If you have an existing user that requires a password, please consult the documentation
on the section about altering roles:  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-alterrole.html
If you desire creating a new user, consult:  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/sql-createrole.html

Assuming you created a user "statusmon" with password "getstatus", you can make sure that
things are configured correctly by using the psql command as follows:

    $ psql -U statusmon -W postgres -h localhost
    Password for user statusmon: <enter password>
    psql (9.3.5)
    SSL connection (cipher: DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA, bits: 256)
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=# 
      
If the configuration is incorrect or you enter an invalid password, you will see something 
similar to:

    $ psql -U statusmon -W postgres -h localhost
    psql: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "statusmon"
    FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "statusmon"
    

Configuring Scalyr Agent

In order to use the PostgreSQL monitor, you need to enter a configuration in the agent.json
file.  A typical fragment resembles:

  monitors: [
    {
      module:              "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.postgres_monitor",
      id:                  "postgres",
      database_host:       "localhost",
      database_name:       "mydb",
      database_username:   "statusmon",
      database_password:   "getstatus" 
    }
  ]
  
The valid configuration options for the module are:

'database_host'       -- Name of host machine the agent will connect to PostgreSQL to retrieve monitoring data.
'database_port'       -- Name of port on the host machine the agent will connect to PostgreSQL to retrieve monitoring data.
'database_name'       -- Name of database the agent will connect to PostgreSQL to retrieve monitoring data.
'database_username'   -- Username which the agent uses to connect to PostgreSQL to retrieve monitoring data.
'database_password'   -- Password for connecting to PostgreSQL.


Metrics

The following metrics are exposed by the postgres_monitor:

postgres.database.connections -- The number of current active connections.  The value is accurate to when the check was made.
postgres.database.transactions_committed -- The number of database transactions that have been committed.
postgres.database.transactions_rolledback -- The number of database transactions that have been rolled back.
postgres.database.disk_blocks_read -- The number of disk blocks read into the database.
postgres.database.disk_blocks_hit -- The number of disk blocks read that were found in the buffer cache.
postgres.database.query_rows_returned -- The number of rows returned by all queries in the database.
postgres.database.query_rows_fetched -- The number of rows fetched by all queries in the database.
postgres.database.query_rows_inserted -- The number of rows inserted by all queries in the database.
postgres.database.query_rows_updated -- The number of rows updated by all queries in the database.
postgres.database.query_rows_deleted -- The number of rows deleted by all queries in the database.
postgres.database.temp_files -- The number of temporary files created by queries to the database.
postgres.database.temp_bytes -- The total amount of data written to temporary files by queries to the database.
postgres.database.temp_bytes -- The total amount of data written to temporary files by queries to the database.
postgres.database.deadlocks -- The number of deadlocks detected in the database.
postgres.database.blocks_read_time -- The amount of time data file blocks are read by clients in the database (in milliseconds).
postgres.database.blocks_write_time -- The amount of time data file blocks are written by clients in the database (in milliseconds).
postgres.database.stats_reset -- The time at which database statistics were last reset.
