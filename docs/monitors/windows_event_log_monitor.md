# Window Event Log Monitor

The Windows Event Log monitor uploads messages from the Windows Event Log to the Scalyr servers.
It can listen to multiple different event sources and also filter by messages of a certain type.

On versions of Windows prior to Vista, the older EventLog API is used.  This API is unable to
retrieve 'Critical' events because this event type was only introduced in Vista.

On versions of Windows from Vista onwards, the newer Evt API is used which can be used to retrieve
'Critical' events.

@class=bg-warning docInfoPanel: An *agent monitor plugin* is a component of the Scalyr Agent. To use a plugin,
simply add it to the ``monitors`` section of the Scalyr Agent configuration file (``/etc/scalyr/agent.json``).
For more information, see [Agent Plugins](/help/scalyr-agent#plugins).

## Sample Configuration

### Windows Vista and later

On Windows Vista and later, the Scalyr agent uses the EvtLog API, and you can configure it to query events on any channel, using the standard XPath query mechanism.  See: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd996910(v=vs.85).aspx

For example, the following will configure the agent to listen to Critical, Error and Warning level events from the Application, Security and System channels:

    monitors: [
      {
        module:                  "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.windows_event_log_monitor",
        channels: [
            { "channel": [ "Application", "Security", "System" ],
              "query": "*[System/Level=1 or System/Level=2 or System/Level=3]"
            }
        ]
      }
    ]

Alternatively, here is a configuration that will log critical errors for the Application channel, and critical, error and warning messages for System and Security channels.

    monitors: [
      {
        module:                  "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.windows_event_log_monitor",
        channels: [
            { "channel": ["Application"],
              "query": "*[System/Level=1]"
            },
            {
              "channel": ["Security", "System" ],
              "query": "*[System/Level=1 or System/Level=2 or System/Level=3]"
            }
        ]
      }
    ]

### Windows Server 2003

For Windows versions earlier than Vista, the Scalyr agent will use the older Event Log API.

This sample will configure the agent running on Windows Server 2003 to listen to Error and Warning level events from the Application, Security
and System sources:

    monitors: [
      {
        module:                  "scalyr_agent.builtin_monitors.windows_event_log_monitor",
        sources:                 "Application, Security, System",
        event_types:             "Error, Warning",
      }
    ]
