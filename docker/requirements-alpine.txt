# Python dependencies for docker images.
# At the moment we don't include orjson and zstandard in Alpine based ARM images since pre-built wheels
# are not available and that requires cross compilation using QEMU which is slow.
orjson==3.6.5; 'arm' not in platform_machine and 'aarch64' not in platform_machine
zstandard==0.16.0; 'arm' not in platform_machine and 'aarch64' not in platform_machine
# Two dependencies below are used for CPU and memory profiling which is opt-in and disabled by
# default. We include it in the Docker image to make  troubleshooting (profiling) easier for the
# end user (no need to rebuild Docker image - user can simply enable the corresponding agent config
# option)
yappi==1.2.3
pympler==0.8
# the version of 'requests' library that 'docker' uses as a dependency is higher than we use in agent,
# to prevent versions conflict, install the appropriate version of 'requests', to force 'docker' to reuse it.
