# Python dependencies for docker images.
# NOTE: orjson and zstandard dependencies don't include pre-built wheels for ARMv7 for glibc and
# musl.
# To avoid very slow cross architecture builds using QEMU on CI we don't (for now) include orjson
# and zstandard dependencies. Both of those dependencies are optional.
# Keep in mind that pre-built wheels are available for ARM64 (e.g. graviton) so we do use those on
# linux/arm64
orjson==3.6.5
zstandard==0.16.0
# Two dependencies below are used for CPU and memory profiling which is opt-in and disabled by
# default. We include it in the Docker image to make  troubleshooting (profiling) easier for the
# end user (no need to rebuild Docker image - user can simply enable the corresponding agent config
# option)
yappi==1.2.3
pympler==0.8
# the version of 'requests' library that 'docker' uses as a dependency is higher than we use in agent,
# to prevent versions conflict, install the appropriate version of 'requests', to force 'docker' to reuse it.
requests==2.20.0
docker==4.1.0
