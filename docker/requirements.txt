# dependencies for docker images.
# NOTE: ujson and orjson don't include pre-built wheels for ARMv7 so we don't
# include those for armv7 builds and simply fall back to json.
# Alernative would be to install rust + arm toolchain in the build docker image
# and instead of using pre-built wheel we would compile wheel in docker image
# (slow)
# Keep in mind that wheels are available for ARM64 (e.g. graviton) so we do use
# those on linux/arm64

# Two dependencies below are used for CPU and memory profiling which is opt-in and disabled by
# default. We include it in the Docker image to make  troubleshooting (profiling) easier for the
# end user (no need to rebuild Docker image - user can simply enable the corresponding agent config
# option)

# the version of 'requests' library that 'docker' uses as a dependency is higher than we use in agent,
# to prevent versions conflict, install the appropriate version of 'requests', to force 'docker' to reuse it.
