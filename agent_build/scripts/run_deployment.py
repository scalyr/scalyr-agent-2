This script accepts command line arguments to operate with deployments (see agent_build/tools/environment_deployments/deployments.py).
Mainly, the script created for the GitHub Action local action - '.github/actions/preform-deployment' to provide ability
to use deployments and cache their results by using Github Actions caching mechanism.

Usage:
    List all available deployments (not used anywhere, but may be useful for debug and manual usage of deployments):

        run_deployment.py list

    Perform some deployment (used by Github Action CI):

        run_deployment.py deployment <deployment_name> deploy  [--cache-dir <cache_dir>]

        The '--cache-dir' option provides path where steps of the deployment store their cached results. Each step
            has its own unique cache name, so our local GutHub action can cache step's results to its own, separate
            cache in the Github Actions. That means that the step that is used by many deployments will be cached only
            once and will be reused by those deployments.

    Get names of all caches of all steps of the deployment.

        run_deployment.py deployment <deployment_name> get-deployment-all-cache-names

        Also a utility command for the Github Action CI to perform the trick with caching, that has been described
            above. The local GitHub action uses those names as cache keys for GitHub Action cache.
