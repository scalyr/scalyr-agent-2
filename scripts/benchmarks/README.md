# Scalyr Agent Benchmarks

This directory contains various scripts which are used to continuously track
agent performance and result utilization over time (commits).

Those scripts run various benchmarks and checks and submit those results to
[CodeSpeed instance][TBW] where this data is tracked and compared over time.
