# This script is meant to be executed by the instance of the 'agent_build_refactored.tools.runner.RunnerStep' class.
# Every RunnerStep provides common environment variables to its script:
#   SOURCE_ROOT: Path to the projects root.
#   STEP_OUTPUT_PATH: Path to the step's output directory.
#
# This script builds Python interpreter from source and then also modifies the result filesystem structure. In short:
#   all installation files of the built Python interpreter have to be located in its special sub-directory.
#   This is crucial, because we have to make sure that Python dependency package won't affect any existing Python
#   installations. For example, instead of filesystem hierarchy of a "normal" package:
#       /usr
#          bin/<package_files>
#          lib/<package_files>
#          share/<package_files>
#          include/<package_files>
#       <etc?
#   the result package is expected to be:
#       /usr
#          lib/<subdir>/<exec-prefix>       // Prefix directory with all platform-dependent files.
#          share/<subdir>/<prefix>          // Prefix directory with all platform-independent files.
#
#
# It expects next environment variables:
#
#   PYTHON_VERSION: Version of the Python to build.
#   PYTHON_INSTALL_PREFIX: Install prefix for the Python installation.
#   SUBDIR_NAME: Name of the sub-directory.

set -e

# Copy python interpreter, which is built by the previous step.
