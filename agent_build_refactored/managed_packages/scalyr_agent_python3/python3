# This script runs given Python executable with additional paths in the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' that

# it adds path to the embedded OpenSSL shared objects, if not, it skips that, so system's dynamic linker
# has to find it.

# This script is a wrapper that calls real Python executable with additional path for  'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' variable in
