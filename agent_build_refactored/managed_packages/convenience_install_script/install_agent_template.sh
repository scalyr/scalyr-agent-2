# Installs necessary packages to run the Scalyr Agent 2 on the host.
# To perform this task, the script  Analyzes the system and attempts to
# install the correct repository configuration files to enable installing
# and updating the Scalyr Agent using either yum or apt-get.  Which
# repository type is used is determined by the available commands on this
# system.
#
# After the repository is set up, then this script install the Scalyr Agent
# packages as well and optionally performs some configuration updates.
#
# This script must be executed as root.
#
# This script has two packages (an RPM and and Debian package) that
# each contain the appropriate configuration files for either the yum
# or apt repository setup.

cat <<EOF
Usage $0 [options] where options are:
    -h,--help              Display this help message."
    --extract-packages     Extracts the embedded RPM and Debian packages to
                           install the Scalyr package repository configuration
                           and exits.
    --use-aio-package      Use "All in one" variant of the package that does not have any system dependencies
                           like Python or OpenSSL.
    --force-apt            Forces the script to install the Scalry APT
                           repository configuration files.
    --force-yum            Forces the script to install the Scalyr Yum
                           repository configuration files.
    --force-alt-yum        Forces the script to install the Scalyr Alternate
                           Yum repository configuration files.  The alternate
                           repository is for older linux systems such as
                           RHEL5 or CentOS 5 which do not support the signing
                           keys used in the main repository.
    --set-api-key KEY      Updates the configuration file with the provided
                           key.
    --read-api-key-from-stdin
                           Prompts the user to enter their account's
                           Write Logs key and updates the configuration
                           file with the result.
    --set-scalyr-server SERVER
                           Updates the configuration with the provided value for
                           the scalyr_server field.  It does this by writing
                           a new configuration fragment.
    --start-agent          If specified, this script will start the agent
                           running in the background once the installation
                           is finished.
    --verbose              If set, will send all of the output from the
                           underlying yum/apt-get commands to stdout instead
                           of piping them to a separate log file.  This output
                           can be a bit hard to read.
    --version              Specifies the version number of the scalyr-agent-2
                           package to install, rather than the latest.
