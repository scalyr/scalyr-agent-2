# This script is meant to be executed by the instance of the 'agent_build_refactored.tools.runner.RunnerStep' class.
# Every RunnerStep provides common environment variables to its script:
#   SOURCE_ROOT: Path to the projects root.
#   STEP_OUTPUT_PATH: Path to the step's output directory.
#
# This script build from source all libraries that are required to build Python. Since we build Python and its
# requirements in a legacy OS (such as Centos 6) to achieve binary compatibility, we also have to build many essential
# build tools because tools from legacy OS's ate too old.
#
# It expects next environment variables:
#
#   XZ_VERSION: version of XZ Utils to build. Python requirement. ALso required by some make and configure scripts.
#   PERL_VERSION: version of Perl to build. Required by some make and configure scripts.
#   TEXINFO_VERSION: version of texinfo to build. Required by some make and configure scripts.
#   M4_VERSION: version of M4 to build. Required by some make and configure scripts.
#   AUTOCONF_VERSION: version of autoconf to build. Required by some make and configure scripts.
#   LIBTOOL_VERSION: version of libtool to build. Required by some make and configure scripts.
#   HELP2MAN_VERSION: version of help2man to build. Required by some make and configure scripts.
#   AUTOMAKE_VERSION: version of automake to build. Required by some make and configure scripts.
#   LZMA_VERSION: version of lzma to build. Python requirement.
#   ZLIB_VERSION: version of zlib to build. Python requirement. Provides zlib module.
#   BZIP_VERSION: version of bzip to build. Python requirement. Provides bz2 module.
#   UTIL_LINUX_VERSION: version of lzma to build. Python requirement. Provides uuid module.
#   NCURSES_VERSION: version of ncurses to build. Python requirement. Provides curses module.
#   LIBEDIT_VERSION: version of libedit to build. Python requirement. Provides non-GPL alternative for readline module.
#   GDBM_VERSION: version of gdbm to build. Python requirement. Provides dbm module.
#   LIBFFI_VERSION: version of libffi to build. Python requirement. Provides ctypes module and essential for C bindings.
#   OPENSSL_VERSION: version of OpenSSL to build. Python requirement. Provides ssl module.
