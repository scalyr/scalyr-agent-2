# This script is meant to be executed by the instance of the 'agent_build_refactored.tools.runner.RunnerStep' class.
# Every RunnerStep provides common environment variables to its script:
#   SOURCE_ROOT: Path to the projects root.
#   STEP_OUTPUT_PATH: Path to the step's output directory.
#
# This script builds from source the Python interpreter for the Agent's dependency package.
#
#
# It expects next environment variables:
#
#   PYTHON_VERSION: Version of the Python to build.
#   PYTHON_INSTALL_PREFIX: Install prefix for the Python installation.
#   SUBDIR_NAME: Name of the sub-directory.
#   ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS: Additional config options for Python building.
