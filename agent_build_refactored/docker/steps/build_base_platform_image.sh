# This script is used to build base image for the agent images and used by a special runner step.
# It produces tarball with base agent image for a particular platform/architecture.

# It expects the next environment variables.
#    PYTHON_BASE_IMAGE: Name of the base image (e.g. python:slim, python:alpine)
#    DISTRO_NAME: name of the base distribution (e.g. debian, alpine)
#    RESULT_IMAGE_TARBALL_NAME: Name of the result image tarball.
#    PLATFORM: Architecture of the result platform.
#    COVERAGE_VERSION: Version coverage to install for test version of the image.
