## Release Notes and Changelog

For release notes please see [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md) document and for changelog,
see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) document.

## Developing

From this repository, you can create your own RPM and Debian packages containing customized versions of
the Scalyr Agent. For instance, you can bundle additional monitoring plugins to collect specialized data
from your servers.

We also welcome submissions from the community.

For information on the agent architecture and code abstractions, please refer to the
[architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) document.

Some of the tests and checks depend on on fixture file from git submodule so you should make sure you
also check out all the submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --recursive --init
```

### Local Development Environment, Tests and Lint Checks

This repository utilizes ``tox`` Python project for running various lint checks and tests in
isolated virtual environment.

Underneath, we use ``py.test`` test runner for running the tests.

For it to work, you need to have ``tox`` Python package installed on the system or inside the virtual
environment which you use for the development.

```bash
pip install tox
```

In addition to that, you also need to have Python version available which is used for a particular
tox target. By default Python 2.7 is used for the unit tests and Python 3.6 for all the lint checks.

To run all the checks you can simply run tox command:

```bash
tox
```

In addition to that, you can also run a specific target or a set of targets using ``-e`` flag. For example:

```bash
# run all the lint targets
tox -elint

# run flake8 and mypy tox target
tox -eflake8,mypy

# run py2.7-unit-tests tox target
tox -epy2.7-unit-tests

# run coverage tox target
tox -ecoverage
```

To run a sub-set of tests or a single test from a test file, you can directly invoke ``pytest``
from a specific tox virtual environment as shown below:

```bash
.tox/py2.7-unit-tests/bin/py.test -vv --durations=5 "<test file>::<test class name>" -k "<test method name>"
```

For example:

```bash
# This will run all the tests in tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py file
.tox/py2.7-unit-tests/bin/py.test -vv --durations=5 "tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py"

# This will run all the test methods on the ``UrlMonitorTestRequest`` class in the
# tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py file
.tox/py2.7-unit-tests/bin/py.test -vv --durations=5 "tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py::UrlMonitorTestRequest"

# This will run ``UrlMonitorTestRequest.test_get_request_no_headers`` test method from the
# tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py file
.tox/py2.7-unit-tests/bin/py.test -vv --durations=5 "tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py::UrlMonitorTestRequest" -k test_get_request_no_headers
```

### Continuous Integration

We run all the tox checks described above (+ more) continuously as part of our Circle CI based
build system.

Each push to a branch / pull request will trigger a build and a subset of the Circle CI jobs.

Additional jobs will run once the PR has been merged into master. The reason we do that is to
speed the PR builds and increase the developer feedback loop (some of the tests and checks we
run are slow so running them on every push to a branch would be slow and wasteful).

Before merging a pull request you need to ensure that all the checks have passed, pull
request has been approved and it's in sync / up to date with latest master.

When all the checks have passed, you should see something like this:

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125088/79736603-59e77f80-82fa-11ea-9e33-b5279a030e8b.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125088/79736603-59e77f80-82fa-11ea-9e33-b5279a030e8b.png" width="450px" /></a>

In addition to that, you should trigger a full build (basically all the jobs which run on merge to
master minus the agent process level benchmarks), by adding ``/run build`` comment to the PR (to
avoid abuse, right now the builds can only be triggered by direct collaborators to this
repository).

This will kick off our StackStorm based build automation and ensure that the whole build passes.

If the build passes, you should see a comment similar to the one below and you are free to merge
your pull request.

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125088/79735434-93b78680-82f8-11ea-804a-43fbe7c543eb.png"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125088/79735434-93b78680-82f8-11ea-804a-43fbe7c543eb.png" width="400px" /></a>

To avoid wasting the build cycles, please make sure you only trigger the whole build once other
checks which run on every PR commit have passed, PR has been approved and it's in sync with master.

If the build has failed, you can re-trigger it by adding the same comment again after you made any
changes / fixes (if necessary).

After the PR has been merged, you should wait for the ``benchmarks`` workflow to complete and then
check our [CodeSpeed instance](https://scalyr-agent-codespeed.herokuapp.com/) to ensure there are
no regressions in terms of the resource utilization (memory and CPU usage) and things such as
increased number of error or warning log lines.

Here is an example which demonstrates a regression in number of error level lines being printed to
the agent log which likely indicates a bug / regression in the code -

### Monitor Plugins

Monitor plugins are one of the key features for Scalyr Agent 2.  These plugins can be used to augment the
functionality of Scalyr Agent 2 beyond just copying logs and metrics.  For example, there are monitor plugins
that will fetch page content at a given URL and then log portions of the returned content.  Another plugin allows
you to execute a shell command periodically and then log the output.  Essentially, plugs can be used to implement
any periodic monitoring task you have.

We encourage users to create their own plugins to cover features they desire.  In the near future, we will be
publishing documentation that describes how to implement your own monitor.  And, if you feel your monitor would
be useful to other Scalyr customers, we encourage you to submit it to monitor collection in the `monitors/contrib`
directory.

To learn how to develop plugins, please see the
[instructions for creating a monitor plugin](docs/CREATING_MONITORS.md).

### Building Packages

NOTE: Docker image build instructions now in the [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)

You can use the `build_packages.py` script to build your own RPM or Debian packages.  This is often desirable
if your company has its own yum or apt repositories, or you have modified the Scalyr Agent 2 code to suit
some particular need.  (Of course, if you are finding you need to modify the Scalyr Agent 2 code, we encourage you
to submit your changes back to the main repository).

You must have the following installed on your machine to create packages:

  * fpm, see https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/
  * rpmbuild (for building RPMs)
  * gnutar / gtar (for building Debian packages)

We strongly suggest you use the same platform that you intend to install the agent on to build the packages.
This is because tools like `rpmbuild` and `gtar` are more available on the platforms that use those respective
packaging systems.

To build the RPM package, execute the following command in the root directory of this repository

    python build_package.py rpm

To build the Debian package, execute the following command in the root directory of this repository

    python build_package.py deb

### Pre-Commit Hooks

This project uses the [Black](http://black.readthedocs.io) code autoformatting tool with default
settings.

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) is used to automatically run checks including Black formatting
prior to a git commit.

To use pre-commit:

- Use one of the [Installation Methods](https://pre-commit.com/#install) from the documentation.
- Install the hooks with `pre-commit install`.
- To manually execute the pre-commit hooks (including black), run `pre-commit run --all-files` (
  run it on all the files) or ``pre-commit run`` (run it only on staged files).

All the pre-commit targets rely on binaries from tox virtual environment so you need to make sure
tox virtual environment for ``lint`` target exists:

```bash
tox -elint --notest --recreate
```

#### Pre-commit Configuration

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configures the scripts run by pre-commit

To update the Pre-commit hooks , run `pre-commit autoupdate`. This will update
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` and will need to be committed to the repository.
